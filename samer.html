paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a<br> single sentence that forms a unit”
 (Lunsford and Connors 116).
 Length and appearance do not determine whether 
 a section in a paper is a paragraph.<br>
 For instance, in some styles of writing,
  particularly journalistic styles,
  a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
